ðŸ“Œ Project Title

Challenge 3: DevSecOps Awareness via CI/CD + Static Code Analysis

ðŸ“„ Project Description

This project demonstrates DevSecOps awareness by setting up an automated CI/CD pipeline for a minimal FastAPI application. The pipeline integrates linting, unit testing, and static code analysis to enforce security and quality gates. This ensures the application is safe, reliable, and deployable in a real-world environment.

Task: Set up CI/CD and security checks for a simple app.
Objective: Show understanding of DevSecOps by creating automated pipelines with basic security and quality gates.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

The project includes:

âœ… CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
âœ… Linting with Flake8
âœ… Unit testing with Pytest
âœ… Static code analysis with Bandit
âœ… Deployment to Render (live API)

ðŸš€ Live API

My deployed API is running here: ðŸ‘‰ https://devsecops-sample-app.onrender.com

Example request:

curl https://devsecops-sample-app.onrender.com/


Example response:

{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Hello DevSecOps!"
}

ðŸ”Ž Reflection

I learned how to integrate linting, testing, and security scans into a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The tricky part was fixing flake8 errors and Bandit setup in the workflow, but solving those helped me understand how pipelines enforce coding standards.

ðŸ¤– Use of AI Tools

I used AI tools to:

Generate initial FastAPI app boilerplate code

Get guidance on fixing linting (flake8) issues

Configure the ci.yml workflow for GitHub Actions

Draft explanations and improve README documentation

This helped me save time and focus more on learning the CI/CD and security integration part.
